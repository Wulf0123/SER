1. First functionality should be able to build a java project from the current directory or by giving a gzip of the file, set where the jar file is saved

- support for testing (junit and testng)
- creates a runnable jar (highest main method wins)
- downloads all jars for the files
- imports are not needed in the java files
- jar is saved in format: name_version_timestamp.jar
- Add var as parent of primitives and objects
- add multiple inheritance (i might have thought about it wrongly, may not actually be possible but idk)
- license management, be aware of what licenses are used for each jar/library used
- add async to function and code snippets (run code inside own thread)
- add c# property like properties
- only work on specifically annotated files, otherwise build them as vanilla java
- Make string concatenation (string + string) use String.format
- Allow annotations for specific library and version (Globally in config, per file, per function, or per line)
- bring in necessary jars on demand, take latest over oldest in requirements
  -- Global: Java System classes
  -- Local: Locally defined classes
  -- External-Local: jars made from code on local machine, need to build as well
  -- External: Third party library to download
- Config is a json file
  -- name.config
  -- Contains name or project, version, and global annotations of dependencies
