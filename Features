Ok need to rename. This is really three things (so we need 4 names overall right now, the name of the entire thing plus a name for each of the components. My vote is on Bob for Bob the Builder :P):
1: Builder - Takes the raw (vanilla) java code and builds it with the jar directory to package a new runnable jar file
2: Compiler - Takes the new java code (with all our cool tricks and treats) and transforms it into vanilla java code to be built by the Builder portion. Also identifies missing libraries, and which ones to be downloaded/used
3: Repo manager - Uses remote and local repositories, as well as specified local jar directories and code and packages it all up into the jar directory for building. 

1. First functionality should be able to build a java project from the current directory or by giving a gzip of the file, set where the jar file is saved
1.2. When building java files maintain checksum of files, if no change has occured do not rebuild class file. unless specified by command line
- support for testing (junit and testng)
- creates a runnable jar (highest main method wins)
- downloads all jars for the files
- imports are not needed in the java files
- jar is saved in format: name_version_timestamp.jar
- Add var as parent of primitives and objects
- add multiple inheritance (i might have thought about it wrongly, may not actually be possible but idk)
- license management, be aware of what licenses are used for each jar/library used
- add async to function and code snippets (run code inside own thread)
- add c# property like properties
- only work on specifically annotated files, otherwise build them as vanilla java
- Make string concatenation (string + string) use String.format
- Allow annotations for specific library and version (Globally in config, per file, per function, or per line)
- bring in necessary jars on demand, take latest over oldest in requirements
  -- Global: Java System classes
  -- Local: Locally defined classes
  -- External-Local: jars made from code on local machine, need to build as well
  -- External: Third party library to download
- Config is a json file
  -- name.config
  -- Contains name or project, version, and global annotations of dependencies
